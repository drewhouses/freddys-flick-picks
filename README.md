# Freddy's Flick Picks

## Description

This project demonstrates the usage of Javascript, CSS, HTML, and the usage of two server-side APIs to create a dynamic and interactive working webpage. The "Cover Page" has working audio and a hidden button on Freddy's body that when clicked, plays another audio and fades the cover page and button out, displaying the main page. 

On the main page, alongside the title and some text, this is where you can click on a random movie generator button that uses an API to pull data from an "online library" to display information about a horror themed movie. The second API used is to display the information of the available streaming platforms you can watch the movie on.
